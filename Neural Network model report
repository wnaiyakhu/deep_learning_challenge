Data Preprocessing

What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
The target variable for the model is "IS_SUCCESSFUL," indicating whether the funding was successful (1) or not (0).

What variable(s) are the features for your model?
The features for the model include metadata about each organization, such as EIN, NAME, APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.

What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?
The variables EIN and NAME were removed from the input data as they are identification columns and do not contribute to the predictive power of the model.

Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
The neural network model has three layers: two hidden layers with 5 and 3 neurons, respectively, and an output layer with 1 neuron.
Activation functions used:
Hidden layers: Tanh activation functions were chosen to introduce non-linearity.
Output layer: Sigmoid activation function to produce binary classification probabilities.

Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
The model achieved an accuracy of approximately 73.02% on the test data. Unable to reach 75% accuracy. 

What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Initially, the model was trained with default architecture and parameters.
The number of neurons in hidden layers was adjusted to observe the impact on performance.
Activation functions were chosen to introduce non-linearity and capture complex relationships.
The model was trained for 100 epochs to allow for learning.
Hyperparameter tuning and alternative model architectures, such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting, were suggested as potential avenues for improvement.
